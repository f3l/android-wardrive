v1.0

    - Scans for visible wireless networks and stores them in sqlite3 DB, in the
      sdcard.
    - Visualize networks around your position with maps.
    - Needs GPS position found to work, either for maps and for scanning wifis.

v1.1

    - Saves last position visited and resets it when application is restarted.
      This will not make a scan for wifis, but stored ones will be visible on
      the map anyway.

    - Can change the meters span that triggers a scan, and the max wifis visible
      on the map.
      
    - WiFis SSID now are displayed near the dots. This can be toggled by menu.
    
    - "Follow ME", can be disabled, but is not saved to preferences: at startup
      it needs the position or it will remain in coords 0,0
      
v1.2

    - Introduced the quadrant view: many wifis in the same screen gets wrapped
      on a bigger dot, still divided between red and green.
      Should improve performance with big numbers (100+).
      This is activated also only when on a zoom level far enough.
    
    - WiFis are updated in a better way. Before all the record was updated only
      when a bigger level (signal strenght) was found. Now for that case only
      "lan, lon, alt, level" are updated, while all other information are always
      updated (frequency, capabilities, ssid...) when the wifi is detected,
      even if ad worse level.
      
    - Changed localization method
    
v1.3

    - Bugfix: on quit application was halting unexpectedly

v1.4

	- Added transparency to circles
	
	- Big circles: they don't take all the map when it's fully zoomed out
	  (proportional scaling up).
	  
v1.5

    - Now the scanning is backed into a service independent from the action.
      The service is stopped when clicking the "quit" menu entry.
      (Something like G-Mon does)
      
v1.6

    - Errors shouldn't make the application to quit now. Instead they're
      displayed briefly in a passive pop-up that hides in a short time.
      
    - New program icon.
    
    - Mapview now can be displayed with terrain also.
    
v1.7

	- The user can now decide if to display open or closed wifis, or both

	- Start/Stop the service via a specific menu command and save that setting
      to preferences.

v1.8

    - The user can now delete the database completely (an empty file remains)

v1.9

    - New Translations: Poland Language

v1.10

	- Exportable KML files
	
	- "Export KML" moved to the top stack of the menu. The delete button should
	  be theorically the less used one in the application and so moved in the
	  "options" group.
	  
v1.11

    - GPS status is printed in toast message by the service when it changes.
    
v1.12

    - Previous had a Bad Google API KEy for certificate.
    
v1.13

    - Faster service and maps updates.

v2.0

	- Send WiFis to online database http://wardrivedb.appstop.com/

v2.1

	- Sends only the newly updated WiFis based on the last sync date.

v2.2

	- Updates timestamps only if effectively updates any info in the record.
	  This will prevent to send duplicate data on sync.

v2.3

    - Lighter syncronization to server, sends smaller packets now (20 each).

v2.4

    - Progress bar while sending to server.
    
v2.5

    - Sending to server now is never started more than once, remains in
      background, and the progress bar can be resumed by choosing "send" again.
    
v2.6

    - Force quit of the application when calling quit.
      This should solve the issue about drawing battery even when closing the app.
      
v2.7

    - Also shows closed wifis count on statistics.
    - Shows last running dates for application and service on statistics.
    - Show last catched wifis since the last service run on statistics.

v2.8

    - XML export now has colored dots depending of WiFis security methods.

v2.9

	- Sending to online database now only sends open wifis.
	- Asks the user to send all WiFis to online db, or to send only new ones.

v2.10

	- Shows yellow for WEP wifis.
	- When service is stopped or started only a toast is displayed, and not any
	  other notifications (users couldn't delete the notification).

v2.11

	- KML export now writes also timestamp
	
v2.12

	- Sounds and vibrates with notification (auto-cancelable) when spotting a new
	  WiFi. Doesn't notify when a WiFi is only updated, only when newly added.
	  
v2.13

    - Service can be better controlled by either diabling the notifications or
      by setting the GPS query interval.
      
      
v2.14

    - Service start stop wasn't correctly notificating with toast messaged. 

v2.14

    - Unexpected service behaviour 

v2.16

    - Added readable date in the KML export

v2.17

    - Added a regexp filter for visible wifis
