v1.0

    - Scans for visible wireless networks and stores them in sqlite3 DB, in the
      sdcard.
    - Visualize networks around your position with maps.
    - Needs GPS position found to work, either for maps and for scanning wifis.

v1.1

    - Saves last position visited and resets it when application is restarted.
      This will not make a scan for wifis, but stored ones will be visible on
      the map anyway.

    - Can change the meters span that triggers a scan, and the max wifis visible
      on the map.
      
    - WiFis SSID now are displayed near the dots. This can be toggled by menu.
    
    - "Follow ME", can be disabled, but is not saved to preferences: at startup
      it needs the position or it will remain in coords 0,0
