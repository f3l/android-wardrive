 - Start/Stop the service via a specific menu command and save that setting
   to preferences.
   Also keep the old "quit" menu method.

 - Realize an interface to see detailed list and details of the WiFis
   (maybe solved when hiding the closed WiFis? - open ones are fewer...)
   
 - Find a way (best efficient) to triangulate WiFi positions

 - Realize a method to synchronize the databases, maybe phone to phone, maybe
   via bluetooth (centralized web repository could grow too much and be
   unhandling by the small android application)
