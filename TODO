 - Add the function to view a report of the Wifi, or currently visible ones
   as a list.
   
 - Alternatively find a way to display better names so that can all be read
   (very difficult if there are too many, generally more than 4)
   
 - Make the points clickable to show other information, or for showing
   information of all the wifi that are in the same spot.
   
 - Find a better method to render >50 wifis instead of asking the user a maximum
   number. 50 WiFis are already too much to show and slows the scrolling a lot.
   Possible solution: show aggregates dots that sums up more wifi and they can
   be clicked to view the list. (maybe a dot whose radius is parametric to the
   number of wifis inside it?)
