 - Add the function to view a report of the Wifi, or currently visible ones
   as a list.
   
 - Alternatively find a way to display better names so that can all be read
   (very difficult if there are too many, generally more than 4)
   
 - Make the points clickable to show other information, or for showing
   information of all the wifi that are in the same spot.
   
 - Realize a method to synchronize the databases, maybe phone to phone, maybe
   via bluetooth
   
 - On Touch event seems to make application crash sometimes, maybe when clicking
   the empty.png rendered 1x1 transparent png image that the systems assumes
   taking over the clickable area.

 - Still optimize Overlays.draw: too much code in there.
