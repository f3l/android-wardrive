 - Add the function to view a report of the Wifi, or currently visible ones
   as a list.
   
 - Alternatively find a way to display better names so that can all be read
   (very difficult if there are too many, generally more than 4)
   
 - Make the points clickable to show other information, or for showing
   information of all the wifi that are in the same spot.
